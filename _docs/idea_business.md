### Project Overview

**Title:** Transparent CPA Marketing Integration for Web3 Ecosystems

**Description:** Our project aims to revolutionize how CPA advertising operates by bridging it with web3 technologies. Leveraging the transparency and trust inherent in blockchain, we propose a software solution that facilitates seamless CPA marketing transactions within the web3 framework, focusing on the integration between high-traffic publishers and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

### Key Stakeholders

1. **Publisher:** CoinMarketCap - A leading crypto asset information portal.
2. **Advertiser:** Uniswap - A prominent decentralized exchange.
3. **CPA Network:** Our software platform, "CPA Web3."

### Objective

To develop a user-friendly, reliable, and transparent web3 tool for CPA marketing. The tool will be tailored for rapid deployment to meet hackathon timelines.

### Business Case

With CoinMarketCap's user base of 3 million daily users, we aim to direct a significant number of leads to Uniswap, which offers a 0.3% fee per transaction. Assuming a conversion rate of 8%, we anticipate approximately 240 successful transactions daily, resulting in a projected monthly revenue for the publisher of approximately $4,000 USD.

### Technical Components
Much more details in documentation, but generally:

1. **Client JavaScript:**
   - A script provided to Uniswap to track referrals from CoinMarketCap.
   - Tracks and attaches unique identifiers such as client ID (wallet address), transaction ID, and campaign ID.

2. **Dune Analytics Integration:**
   - Utilize Dune Analytics to store and verify transaction data.
   - Retrieve campaign performance data for accurate reward calculation via a custom API dashboard.

3. **Smart Contract Development:**
   - Create a smart contract on the Ethereum network to manage the campaign parameters and payouts.
   - Variables: campaign_id, publisher_wallet_address, advertiser_wallet_address, campaign duration, reward percentage, planned lead amount, and conversion rate.

4. **User Interface Demo:**
   - Develop a prototype interface demonstrating the initiation of the smart contract functions, such as revenue calculations and payouts.
